description: Brand/theme decisions, API quota tradeoff, logo geometry, and chain-icon setup for the OpenFlow Trust Infrastructure frontend.

- Brand direction is strict: pure black (#000000) background everywhere, mint/emerald accent (~#00E5A0), monospace typography (JetBrains Mono). Red = compromised/danger, amber = warning. Keep new UI consistent with this rather than defaulting to a generic light/dark theme.
- The backend's anonymous rate limit (3 requests/day) is shared across score + history lookups — fetching history for a wallet counts against the same quota as fetching its score. Any new feature that calls the scoring API must account for this shared budget rather than assuming independent quotas.
- Project's `tsconfig.app.json` intentionally omits `baseUrl` and defines the `@/*` path alias directly under `paths` only. This project uses TypeScript ~6.0.3 (beta, from a Vite 8 template) which deprecates `baseUrl`; adding it back will cause a config warning/error.
- Logo is a programmatically generated nautilus spiral (single continuous path, exponential radius decay from outer to inner, ~2 turns) in `Logo.tsx` — not a static asset. If it ever looks like a plain circular swirl again, increase `turns` and use exponential (not linear/power) radius decay so two visually distinct coils remain visible even at small sizes.
- Chain/network logos come from `@web3icons/react` (`Network<Name>` components, e.g. `NetworkArbitrumOne` for "arbitrum", `NetworkBinanceSmartChain` for "bsc") — mapped by chain id in `ChainIcon.tsx`. Package is large (~99MB unpacked) but only the used components are bundled by Vite tree-shaking.
- Layout.tsx wraps ALL routes (including /admin) in `.app-main` which has `max-width: 720px; margin: 0 auto`. Admin panel must override this via `.app-main:has(.admin-shell), .app-main:has(.admin-gate) { max-width: 100%; width: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; }` in index.css — already done.
- Ahmad handles all Git operations himself (push, PR, merge). Never push or open PRs. Build only, then notify when done.
- PlanConfigs PATCH sends `{ daily_limit, description }` in snake_case — correct. Backend endpoint: PATCH /admin/plan-configs/{plan_name}.
